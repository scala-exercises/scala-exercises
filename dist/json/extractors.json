      "preparagraph": "In Scala, patterns can be defined independently of case classes. To this end, a method named `unapply` is defined to yield a so-called extractor.\n\nFor instance, the following code defines an extractor object `Twice`.\n\n\n    object Twice {\n      def apply(x: Int): Int = x * 2\n      def unapply(z: Int): Option[Int] = if (z%2 == 0) Some(z/2) else None\n    }\n\n    object TwiceTest extends Application {\n      val x = Twice(21)\n      x match { case Twice(n) => Console.println(n) } // prints 21\n    }\n\n\nThere are two syntactic conventions at work here:\n\n* The pattern `case Twice(n)` will cause an invocation of `Twice.unapply`, which is used to match even number; the return value of the `unapply` signals whether the argument has matched or not, and any sub-values that can be used for further matching. Here, the sub-value is `z/2`\n* The `apply` method is not necessary for pattern matching. It is only used to mimick a constructor. `val x = Twice(21)` expands to `val x = Twice.apply(21)`.\n\nThe return type of an `unapply` should be chosen as follows:\n\n* If it is just a test, return a `Boolean`. For instance `case even()`\n* If it returns a single sub-value of type `T`, return a `Option[T]`\n* If you want to return several sub-values `T1,...,Tn`, group them in an optional tuple `Option[(T1,...,Tn)]`.\n\nSometimes, the number of sub-values is fixed and we would like to return a sequence. For this reason, you can also define patterns through `unapplySeq`. The last sub-value type `Tn` has to be `Seq[S]`. This mechanism is used for instance in pattern `case List(x1, ..., xn)`.\n\nWhen you create a case class, it automatically can be used with pattern matching since it has an extractor:\n",

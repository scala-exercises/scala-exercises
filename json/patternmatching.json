      "preparagraph": "Scala has a built-in general pattern matching mechanism. It allows to match on any sort of data with a first-match policy. \nHere is a small example which shows how to match against an integer value:\n\n```\nobject MatchTest1 extends App {\n  def matchTest(x: Int): String = x match {\n    case 1 => \"one\"\n    case 2 => \"two\"\n    case _ => \"many\"\n  }\n  println(matchTest(3))\n}\n```\n\nThe block with the `case` statements defines a function which maps integers to strings. The `match` keyword provides a convenient way of applying a function (like the pattern matching function above) to an object.\n\nScala’s pattern matching statement is most useful for matching on algebraic types expressed via `case classes`.\nScala also allows the definition of patterns independently of case classes, using `unapply` methods in extractor objects.\n\nPattern matching returns something:",

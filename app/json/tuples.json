Unlike an array or list, a tuple can hold objects with different types but they are also immutable. Here is an example of a tuple holding an integer, a string, and the console:\n\n```\nval t = (1, \"hello\", Console)\n```\n\nWhich is syntactic sugar (short cut) for the following:\n\n```\nval t = new Tuple3(1, \"hello\", Console)\n```\nAs you can see, tuples can be created easily:",

      "preparagraph": "The next trait from the top in the collections hierarchy is `Iterable`. All methods in this trait are defined in terms of an an abstract method, `iterator`, which yields the collection's elements one by one. The `foreach` method from trait `Traversable` is implemented in `Iterable` in terms of `iterator`. Here is the actual implementation:\n\n\n    def foreach[U](f: Elem => U): Unit = {\n      val it = iterator\n      while (it.hasNext) f(it.next())\n    }\n\n\nQuite a few subclasses of `Iterable` override this standard implementation of foreach in `Iterable`, because they can provide a more efficient implementation. Remember that `foreach` is the basis of the implementation of all operations in `Traversable`, so its performance matters.\n\nSome known iterators are *Sets*, *Lists*, *Vectors*, *Stacks*, and *Streams*. Iterator has two important methods:  `hasNext`, which answers whether the iterator has another element available. `next` which will return the next element in the iterator.\n",
